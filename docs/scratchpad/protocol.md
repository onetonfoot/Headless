# Protocol

The devtools protocol is split up into various domains e.g Networking, DOM, Page. See
the devtools for protocol for more information on each domain.

Headless provides two ways to interact with a domain either via commands or events.

```@meta
DocTestSetup = quote
  using Headless
  chrome = Chrome(headless=true, port=9223)
end
```

## Commands

Commands can be used to call methods on chrome #rewords..

```jldoctest
using Headless.Protocol: Page

cmd = Page.navigate("www.google.com")
tab = chrome[:tab1]
tab(cmd)
```

Commands can be composed together

## Events

Events are generated by chrome, by subscriping to events your program can respond to the browser.
